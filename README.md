This an attempt to simulate perfectly elastic collisions using OpenGL, GLFW, GLAD, and C++. 
This physics simulator demonstrates the principles of conservation of momentum and conservation of kinetic energy through 2 boxes. 
The 1st box (larger) contains double the mass of the 2nd box (smaller).
This attempt uses discrete collision detection and a low collision detection resolution which may lead to tunneling with higher velocities.
